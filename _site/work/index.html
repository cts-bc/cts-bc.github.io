  <h3>Traffic Impact Assessments</h3>
  <p> Traffic impact studies are often required by governing authorities when any proposed development or network change may impact the performance of the adjacent network. These assessments can provide the basis upon the developer and the authority can coordinate efforts to mitigate any negative effects created as a result of the proposed changes.</p>
  <p>CTS has conducted traffic impact assessments for various applications including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Proposed development traffic impact assessments
    <li>Development expansion traffic impact assessments
    <li>Network change traffic impact assessments
    <li>Before and after studies
  </ul>

  <h3>Transport Planning</h3>

    <div class="column col-8 col-lg-12">
      <p>Transport planning is a complex phenomenon involving many factors and is often interdisciplinary in nature.</p>
      <p>The aim of transport planning is to look forward, determine future demand and forge alternatives which will address the concerns and cater to the main objectives of the project. Transportation planning may involve a proposed capital works initiative, or it may involve changes to existing conditions. Ultimately, transportation planning informs decision-makers and provides them the necessary tools to make appropriate choices.</p>
      <p>CTS provides a full range of traffic and transportation planning services, including:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Traffic demand forecasting
	<li>Major road network studies
	<li>Regional and municipal transportation studies
	<li>Strategic planning and feasibility studies
	<li>Transportation alternatives studies
	<li>Transportation demand management
      </ul>

  <h3>Transportation Engineering</h3>
  <p>Transportation engineering studies involve either examining a specific problem or reviewing the performance of a transportation facility at regular intervals as part of a transportation monitoring program.  Typically, a transportation engineering study will include the assessment of the movement of people and goods through a transportation facility and may involve any of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Intersection and driveway studies
    <li>Corridor studies
    <li>Warrant assessments
    <li>Freeway and managed lane studies
    <li>Pedestrian and bicycle studies
    <li>Public transport studies
    <li>Goods movement studies
    <li>Transportation inventories
    <li>Traffic collision studies
    <li>Alternative safety studies
  </ul>

  <h3>Transportation Surveys</h3>
  <p>Transportation surveys are conducted selectively to measure the existing conditions and provideus with the essential information required for traffic engineering and transportation planning related tasks.</p>
  <p>Transportation surveys can range from simple manual traffic counts to more complex multi-purpose data collection programs.</p>
  <p>CTS is staffed and experienced to provide the entire spectrum of data collection services, including:</p>
  <div class="columns">
    <div class="column col-6 col-lg-12">
      <ul> 
	<li>Intersection traffic movement counts
	<li>Trip generation surveys
	<li>Screen-line counts, both manual and automatic (ATR)
	<li>Transit boarding/alighting surveys
	<li>Travel time/delay/queuing surveys
	<li>Vehicle occupancy surveys
	<li>Vehicle classification surveys
	<li>Parking surveys (utilization, turnover, etc.)
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="column col-6 col-lg-12">
      <ul>
	<li>Spot speed studies
	<li>Sight distance measurements
	<li>Horizontal curve measurements (inclinometer ball-bank testing)
	<li>Traffic control compliance surveys
	<li>Origination-destination studies
	<li>License plate trace surveys
	<li>Modal choice surveys
	<li>Facilities inventory

  <h3>Parking Studies</h3>
  <div class="columns">
    <div class="column col-6 col-sm-12">
      <p>Parking studies are undertaken to assess existing parking demand and operating conditions, to project future parking requirements or to develop parking policies and regulations.</p>
      <p>Parking surveys form a critical component of most parking studies and typically include both an inventory of parking supply and observing parking demand by time of day, otherwise known as parking accumulation surveys.</p>
      <p>Additional parking studies may involve parking duration or turnover studies, which determine the frequency of turnover that a parking space has.</p>
